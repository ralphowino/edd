## Roadmap

### Proof of Concept

#### Plugins
 - ~~Use components as plugins~~
 
#### Template Builder
 - Ask questions based on jsf definitions
    - Options:
        - ~~string~~
        - integer
        - choices
        - boolean
        - code
        - array
   
 - ~~Generate full files in proper path~~
 - GUI reading files and simply showing jsf forms with collapse
 
#### Template/Library Management
 - Allow saving answers as templates
 - Save as json or yaml
 - Templates and libraries either stored globally ~/.eddie or within project ./.eddie
 - Prefer local over global projects
 
#### File manager
 - Ask/Overwrite/Skip if existing
